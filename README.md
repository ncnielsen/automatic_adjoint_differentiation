An implementation of Automatic Adjoint Differentiation (AAD) in the programming language Rust. The long-term goal of this library, is to provide an implementation of AAD that operates on general (m, n) Tensors and with built-in support for partitioning.

See more details about this project on www.NumericalSolution.com under the Projects tab. Here you will also discover that this project is part of a larger ambition to provide support for scalable scientific calculation on general (m, n) Tensors.

Should you wish to join this effort and contribute code, the project builds on the following principles:

1) First make it work, then make it fast. Premature optimization can lay any good code base in ruins before it has even been completed.

2) Use functional language principles wherever possible, to increase readability

3) Iterations, iterations, iterations. Every great project started out small. While the vision for this project is both grand and ambitious, we take one step at a time. We acknowledge that we have much to learn, and we plan on learning by doing.

4) Free and Open Source Software. This software is MIT Licensed granting a wide range of permission with very few restrictions and high license compatibility.
